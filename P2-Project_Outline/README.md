## Submission Instructions

### Roleplay App Overview
This app will allow users to come together to tell stories and roleplay together. The app should allow users to create profiles for each of their characters and provide the tools necessary to manage them. They should also be able to  set the stories to private or public. 

I came up with the idea for this app while watching my GF roleplay with some friends online through basic text messages or online chat groups. Her and her friends have dozens  of characters that they manage through many different methods at the moment, ranging from pen and paper to word documents. I would hope to give them a unified location to complete both parts of their hobby
